      'Section 80C allows deductions up to ₹1.5 lakh from your taxable income. Common instruments include EPF, PPF, ELSS, and life insurance premiums. Choose based on liquidity, risk, and goals. ELSS offers market-linked returns and the shortest lock-in among tax-saving options. For conservative investors, PPF ensures safety and long-term growth. Diversify across these to balance safety and returns while fully utilizing the deduction limit.',

      'House Rent Allowance (HRA) is a common salary component. The exempt amount is the minimum of: (i) Actual HRA received, (ii) 50% of Basic in metro/40% in non-metro, and (iii) Rent paid minus 10% of Basic. Example: If your Basic is ₹50,000 and rent is ₹25,000 in a metro city, the eligible exemption calculation changes depending on actual HRA received. Always keep rent receipts or rent agreement as proof, especially if rent exceeds ₹1 lakh annually (PAN of landlord required).',

    category: 'Taxation in India',
    content:
      'If your total deductions (80C, 80D, housing loan interest, NPS, etc.) are low, the New Regime may be better due to reduced tax rates and simplified slabs. If you actively invest for tax savings and have allowances like HRA and LTA, the Old Regime can save more. A practical thumb rule: If your deductions exceed ₹3 lakh annually, the Old Regime is likely beneficial. Otherwise, choose the New Regime for simplicity.',

    category: 'Salary & Compensation',
    content:
      'CTC (Cost to Company) includes every benefit: fixed salary, employer contributions, and perks. However, in-hand salary is often lower due to PF, gratuity, professional tax, and income tax. For example, if your CTC is ₹10 LPA, your take-home may be around ₹65,000/month after deductions. Always request a detailed salary structure to avoid confusion. Knowing the difference helps in job negotiations and realistic budgeting.',

      'Many taxpayers stop at 80C, but there are multiple sections that offer additional benefits: 80D (health insurance premiums up to ₹25,000/₹50,000 for senior citizens), 80CCD(1B) (additional ₹50,000 for NPS contributions), and 24(b) (housing loan interest up to ₹2 lakh). Using these wisely can reduce taxable income significantly. For instance, combining 80C + 80D + NPS can save you over ₹60,000 in taxes annually in the 30% slab.',

    category: 'Investments',
    content:
      'EPF (Employee Provident Fund) is linked to your job and offers employer contributions plus decent interest (currently 8.15%). It is great for salaried employees. PPF (Public Provident Fund) is open to everyone, with a 15-year lock-in and tax-free returns (7.1%). If you are salaried, maximize EPF first since it is automatic and matched by employer. Use PPF for long-term goals like retirement, especially if you want safe and tax-free growth independent of your job.',

      'LTA can be claimed only for travel within India, and only for actual travel expenses (not hotel or food). You can claim exemption twice in a block of four years. Bills and tickets are necessary proof. Example: If your company provides ₹40,000 as LTA, and you travel by flight costing ₹25,000, only ₹25,000 will be tax-exempt. Plan travel wisely to avoid losing out on this benefit.',

      'Start early in the financial year by estimating your income and possible deductions. Maximize 80C through EPF, ELSS, or insurance. Buy health insurance for 80D benefits. Contribute to NPS for additional deductions. Consider home loan interest (24b) and education loan interest (80E). Avoid last-minute investments in unsuitable products.

Timely and accurate filing not only avoids notices but also ensures faster refunds. Use e-verification through Aadhaar OTP or net banking to complete the process smoothly.',
